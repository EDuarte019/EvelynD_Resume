        <p>In this project, I discovered the language of HTML5. we placed information using elements like body, parargraph and footers. HTML is the base used in a website, as well as the information that is inputed in the website. The Hypertext Markup Language uses semantic elements. In HTML, one will link in other style sheets to develop a visually appealing website.   </p>

        <p>In this project, I learned about the graphics to CSS3. In simple terms, we learned the way to transition colors in different ways, how to design certain elements with borders or with shadows on elements. Basically, the little things that make the website 10x better. </p>
