                I became involved in the ASU TRIO program Sophomore year(2017), we attend meetings where we discuss
                about
                preparing for college and how to utilize resources. Also, we must visit and get involved in other
                events,
                which we call workshops, in order to stay in.
            </p>

                I took part in the Barrett Summer Scholars Program in 2016. In the program, we were able to stay at the
                ASU
                campus for a week. Also, while being in the program, I took a class for technology.</p>

                I took part of National Junior Honors Society. During the duration of this, I volunteered many of my
                hours
                to helping teachers and the community. Every meeting, we helped the school by collecting the recycling
                equipment.</p>
