  <section class="right">
    <p>Hello! I am a student in West-Mec and Copper Canyon High School. From adolescence, my main priority has been
      school. I've dedicated an extraordinary amount of time to school and making an effort to do the best I can in my
      academics and be the best person I could be, within.</p>
    <p>I was born in San Francisco, California but grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. As I transitioned into my teenage
      years,
      I began to get into cheerleading for my middle school, WestWind Elementary. Along with cheerleading, I got into
      the track team. In fact, I did cheerleading and track for two years. </p>
